# GDP (Gross Domestic Product) Analysis using Power BI

## Scenario
Working as a Data Analyst in the Development Indicators Sector of the World Bank, I am responsible for analysing economic performance, comparing GDP of countries, and predicting economic trends from a data set includes information about annual GDP % change for various countries and regions between 1961-2022. The dataset is provided by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). 

## Task
Analyse the .csv data source files provided and create a report using Power BI using a variety of appropriate visualisations. 

## Insights
Using the Power BI dashboards I've created you can dynamically filter and interogate the data, filtering where applicable by region, country, income group (as categorised by the OECD) and year. Some of the insights seen in the following snapshots include:

- All global regions experienced a negative annual GDP % change in 2020 which is likely explained as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated negative economic effects this worldwide event caused at the time.

- Out of the 'Lower middle income' countries of South Asia, Bangladesh is shown to have had a sharp GDP % decline in 1972 versus other countries in that region. Ater a war against Pakistan during 1971, Bangladesh achieved independence on 16th December 1971 however the fallout from this meant the country experienced severe famine in 1972 leading to many deaths and the lack of economic output. Since then the country has received sustantial aid and grants from the World Bank and other nations that has helped it stabilise and support it's people and economy as can be largely seen in the years thereafter, although the effects of other periods of famine can be seen to negatively effect the countries GDP in 1975 and 1983 also.

- Of particular note too, is the GDP growth spike that occurred in Bhutan 1987 of over 25%. This was when the Chhukha Hydropower Plant was constructed, propelling Bhutanâ€™s growth as the country was able to take advantage of greater stability in their enegy resources and the econmic benefits of being able to export that energy to other countries as well.

## Requirements
If you wish to run your own analysis you can import the included .csv data source files into Microsoft's Power BI Desktop. Current download link: https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-gb/desktop/

Feel free to open the analysis and play around with the filters and visulations I've created by opening the file with .pbix extension in Power BI instead.
